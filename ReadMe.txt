1. Run the file "XY_coefficient".
2. Then run the files "1_mid_sensitivity" and "2_old_sensitivity" to examine the effects of each parameter on the output g_{10}^* and n^*;

3. Run the file "XY_coefficient".
4. Then run the files "3_mid_optimization" and "4_old_optimization" to do the mechanics_based optimization procedure.

5. Run the file "BPNN_GA_inverse" to know the design efforts.
